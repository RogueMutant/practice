Full-stack practice repo covering advanced CSS, Tailwind, Node.js, React, TypeScript, and more.

# 🔧 Fullstack Dev Practice Hub

Welcome to my personal full-stack development playground — a structured repo where I sharpen my skills across frontend and backend technologies, one small project at a time.

This repo is organized by tech topics and contains hands-on mini projects, experiments, and notes.

## 📚 Technologies I'm Practicing

- **Advanced CSS** – Animations, grids, flex, layouts, and creative UI challenges.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first design system for quick UIs.
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript for scalable code.
- **Node.js** – REST APIs, JWT-based authentication, CLI tools.
- **JWT & OAuth** – Auth flows using JSON Web Tokens and third-party providers.
- **React** – Component-based frontend projects.
- **Next.js** – Fullstack React framework (with 3 project builds).
- **Vue + Vite** – Lightweight SPA builds and Vue basics.
- **cURL** – Testing and working with HTTP requests in the terminal.
- **Hosting** – Deploying with Vercel, Netlify, and others.
